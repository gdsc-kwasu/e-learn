## **Getting Started with Figma**

### **What is Figma?**

Figma is free to use. [_Sign up here..._](http://bit.ly/2q7OwRV)

Figma is where teams design together. Bring ideas to life in a design, wireframe, or prototype. Partner with teammates from content creation to design implementation. Get better feedback from your stakeholders. Figma gets everyone on the same pageâ€”literally.
